# Translucency Modeling and Analysis by BSSRDF at Norwegian University of Science and Technology

Model optimally translucent materials by the use of a rapid image-based measurement technique and the fitting of a Bidirectional Scattering Surface Reflectance Distribution Function model.
* Image acquisition using a High Dynamic Range method.
* Fitting of the model.
* Estimation of the absorption and scattering coefficients.
